## About uberAgent Custom Scripts

uberAgent can collect data for arbitrary custom metrics through a generic script execution engine. It runs any type of script at any desired interval, either per machine or per user session. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/uberagent/current-release/advanced-topics/uberagent-custom-scripts/) for details.

## About This Repository

Many of these scripts are part of an [uberAgent practice guide](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/uberagent/current-release/practice-guides). Practice guides explain how to utilize uberAgent in real scenarios. They may show how to generate a specific type of report or how to collect additional data.

Each script is documented in its own folder.
